/**
 * A logical transformation function.
 * <p>
 * This does not support applying transformations; it only communicates the type of transformation
 * and its input column references.
 * <p>
 * This interface is used to pass partitioning transformations to v2 catalog implementations. For
 * example a table may partition data by the date of a timestamp column, ts, using
 * <code>date(ts)</code>. This is similar to org.apache.spark.sql.sources.Filter, which is used to
 * pass boolean filter expressions to data source implementations.
 * <p>
 * To use data values directly as partition values, use the "identity" transform:
 * <code>identity(col)</code>. Identity partition transforms are the only transforms used by Hive.
 * For Hive tables, SQL statements produce data columns that are used without modification to
 * partition the remaining data columns.
 * <p>
 * Table formats other than Hive can use partition transforms to automatically derive partition
 * values from rows and to transform data predicates to partition predicates.
